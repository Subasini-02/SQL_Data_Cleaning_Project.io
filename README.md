Project Title: Data Cleaning of Electric Vehicle Population Dataset in MS SQL

Brief:

This project involved cleaning and preparing an Electric Vehicle (EV) Population dataset using Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL). The raw dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues that needed to be resolved for accurate analysis and reporting.

Key tasks performed included:

Identifying and handling missing or null values

Standardizing categorical values (e.g., EV makes and models)

Removing duplicate records

Correcting data types and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., date formats, numeric fields)

Filtering out irrelevant or out-of-scope entries

Creating clean, structured tables for downstream analytics

The goal of the project was to ensure the dataset was reliable, consistent, and analysis-ready, enabling better insights into electric vehicle adoption and trends.
